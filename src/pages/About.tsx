            What is interleaf
          </h2>
          <p>
            interleaf is a calm scratchpad for short-lived work notes. It opens directly into
            writing — no dashboard, no onboarding, no empty state asking you to create your first
            project. Just a cursor and a blank page.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Notes live in your browser. There are no accounts to create, no cloud to sync to, and no
            AI features to dismiss. interleaf does one thing and tries to stay out of your way while
            doing it.

            Why it exists
          </h2>
          <p>
            Most note-taking apps want to be your "second brain." They offer databases, backlinks,
            templates, and collaboration. That's fine for long-lived knowledge. But most of what you
            actually write day-to-day is temporary — a phone number, a meeting outline, a draft
            email, a list of things to buy on the way home.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Those notes don't need a folder hierarchy. They don't need to be shared. They need to be
            written quickly, found easily, and discarded when they're no longer useful. interleaf is
            built for that kind of writing.
          </p>

            Local-first philosophy
          </h2>
          <p>
            Your notes are stored in this browser using IndexedDB. Nothing leaves your device. There
            is no server component, no API, no database running somewhere else. When you close the
            tab, your notes are still here. When you come back tomorrow, they're waiting.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            This means interleaf works offline. Once the app is loaded, it doesn't need a network
            connection. You can install it as a PWA and treat it like any other application on your
            device.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            The trade-off is intentional: notes live in one browser on one device. If you clear your
            browser storage, notes go with it. Export is the intended backup path — plain text,
            Markdown, or a ZIP archive of everything.

            Open source
          </h2>
          <p>
            interleaf is open-source and designed to be deployed as a static site. You can run it
            yourself, audit the code, or adapt it to your own needs. No part of the application
            depends on a paid service or a proprietary backend.
