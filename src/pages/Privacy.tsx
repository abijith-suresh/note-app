            No accounts, no servers
          </h2>
          <p>
            interleaf does not require an account. There is no sign-up form, no email verification,
            no password to remember. The app loads in your browser and starts working immediately.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Because there is no server component, there is nothing to breach, no database to
            compromise, and no credentials to steal. The application is a static site — HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript served from a CDN.

            Your data stays in this browser
          </h2>
          <p>
            Notes are stored locally using IndexedDB, a browser-native storage mechanism. No note
            content is ever transmitted over the network. The app does not make API calls, open
            WebSockets, or communicate with any backend.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            What you write stays on your device until you decide to export it or clear your browser
            data.

            Export is your backup
          </h2>
          <p>
            Because notes live only in browser storage, clearing your browsing data can remove them.
            interleaf treats export as the primary backup path — not as an afterthought.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            You can export any note as plain text or Markdown. You can also export all notes at once
            as a ZIP archive. These files are standard formats that any text editor can open. Your
            words are never locked in.

                  interleaf does not use Google Analytics or any third-party tracking. There are no
                  page views counted, no events recorded, no user behavior profiled.

                  The app stores a single preference (your theme choice) in localStorage. No cookies
                  are set, read, or shared.

                  interleaf does not embed third-party scripts, fonts fetched from external CDNs, or
                  remote dependencies at runtime. Everything needed to run the app is bundled at
                  build time.
